Fun Fact: Nancy Pelosi's father was the Mayor of Baltimore who put up all the Confederate statues there.,1
No way! LOL if true!,0

"The precedent has been set, she needs to be villified and step down immediately. According to some we are responsible for the actions of our ancestors. Conor Daly lost his race sponsorship because of a rumor that his father Derek used racist terms in an interview.",1
Those are the rules.,0
Time for impeachment.,1
I agree. We should impeach @SpeakerPelosi and the rest of her cohorts in Congress for lying to the American people these past 3 yrs!!,1
"I agree,  however they've been lying far longer than 3 years.  It's been decades.  People have only become more aware of it the past three years.",1
"The internet and social media have been their downfall, they don’t have the resources to stop the free flow of information. Their worst nightmare has come true the population is waking up at an ever increasing rate and can see right through them, it’s a bad time to be a corrupt.",1
"Call Trump out for racism, maligning members who are PoC & his disdain for minorities. Move for censure. Then impeach him. He’s a corrupt crook, selling us out to Russia & covering it up. But his hatred for Americans & inciting attacks against them shld inform his removal.",1
that's the biggest bunch of BullShit I ever heard,1
"Funny how Trump is the one under attack from ""ppl of color"" in Congress. Democrats r the ones who have incited violence. 

Remember that Trump supporter who shot Scalise at the baseball practice & the one who firebombed an ICE facility.. oh yeah ... THOSE WERE DEM SUPPORTERS!",1
"Really?  Remember the Charlottesville Riots with the neo-Nazis?  Trumps statement, ""There were GOOD PEOPLE on both sides!""  Anyone ever heard of a ""Good Nazi?""",1
You are factually incorrect.  The Charlottesville demonstrations were to denounce the removals of statues /other memorials of anyone the Left decided was politically incorrect by 21st century standards.  THAT was the debate about which he said there were good people on both sides,1
Remember racist Nancy and racist cummings use Hitler's playbook to repeat the lie over and over till it is believed.  Get a clue Trump haters  Good people were there because they are NOT like ISIS demonrats destroying history.,1
"Leftists blindly believe everything their Leaders & MSM'S tell them EVEN when the FACTS prove they are lying. Like the FAKE Russian COLLUSION charges, based on LIES & a fraudulent document devised by corrupt Dem Leaders, with help from Russian, British & other Foreign operatives.",1

"In these troubled times, I like to put my hand over the kidney in my heart, stare at the moon of Mars contemplating how the wheel is older than the wall, the great things Frederick Douglass is doing & just being thankful I have ID to buy cereal & I don’t have windmill cancer.",0
I then proceed to marvel at the airports first established during the Revolutionary War,0
And how our country banded together during the baggage handler riots of 1780. A lot of covfefe was destroyed that day.,0
And then look directly at a solar eclipse to thank god I have not got cancer from wind turbines,0
"Damn,  I’m tired.  I could use a Covfefe",0

How can anyone forget that heroic day when the LAX air traffic control workers stopped the Bowling Green Massacre!? So many bowling pins were murdered ruthlessly. Sad.,1
"Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s the legal immigration system. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. We have a barrier. Fix the system, fix the problem #FactCheckMAGA",1
"Donald Trump’s lies about immigration are near criminal. Republicans can’t even agree on a bill. Democrats don’t want open borders and passed bi-partisan immigration reform S.B. 744, Republicans obstructed. Fact is, Republicans don’t want the system fixed #FactCheckMAGA",1

He's counting on his base not understanding basic economics. He's likely right.  Then again - this is how he drove so many companies into bankruptcy.,1
